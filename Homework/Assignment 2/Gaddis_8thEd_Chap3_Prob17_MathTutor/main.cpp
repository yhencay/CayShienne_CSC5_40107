 * Purpose: Homework Math Tutor
 *      Problem: Write a program that can be used as a math tutor for a young 
 * student. The program should display two random numbers to be added, such as 
 *       247
 *     +129
 * The program should then pause while the student works on the problem. When 
 * the student is ready to check the answer, he or she can press a key and the 
 * program will display the correct solution:
 *       247
 *     +129
 *       376
