 * Purpose: Homework Driver's License Exam
 * 
 *      Problem: The local Driver’s License Office has asked you to write a 
 * program that grades the written portion of the driver’s license exam. The 
 * exam has 20 multiple choice questions. Here are the correct answers:
 * 
 *      1. A        6. B        11. A       16. C
 *      2. D        7. A        12. C       17. C
 *      3. B        8. B        13. D       18. A
 *      4. B        9. C        14. B       19. D
 *      5. C        10. D       15. D       20. B
 * 
 *   Your program should store the correct answers shown above in an array. It 
 * should ask the user to enter the student’s answers for each of the 20 
 * questions, and the answers should be stored in another array. After the 
 * student’s answers have been entered, the program should display a message 
 * indicating whether the student passed or failed the exam. (A student must 
 * correctly answer 15 of the 20 questions to pass the exam.) It should then 
 * display the total number of correctly answered questions, the total number of 
 * incorrectly answered questions, and a list showing the question numbers of 
 * the incorrectly answered questions.
 * 
 *      Input Validation: Only accept the letters A, B, C, or D as answers.
