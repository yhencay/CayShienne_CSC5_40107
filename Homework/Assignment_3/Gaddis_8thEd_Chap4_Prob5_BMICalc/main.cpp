 * Purpose: Homework Body Mass Index Calculator
 *      Problem: Write a program that calculates and displays a person’s body 
 * mass index (BMI). The BMI is often used to determine whether a person with a 
 * sedentary lifestyle is overweight or underweight for his or her height. A 
 * person’s BMI is calculated with the following formula:
 *              BMI = weight x 703 / height2
 * where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured in inches. The 
 * program should display a message indicating whether the person has optimal 
 * weight, is underweight, or is overweight. A sedentary person’s weight is 
 * considered to be optimal if his or her BMI is between 18.5 and 25. If the BMI 
 * is less than 18.5, the person is considered to be underweight. If the BMI 
 * value is greater than 25, the person is considered to be overweight.
