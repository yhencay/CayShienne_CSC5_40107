 * Purpose: Homework Color Mixer
 *      Problem: The colors red, blue, and yellow are known as the primary 
 * colors because they cannot be made by mixing other colors. When you mix two 
 * primary colors, you get a secondary color, as shown here:
 *          When you mix red and blue, you get purple.
 *          When you mix red and yellow, you get orange.
 *          When you mix blue and yellow, you get green.
 *      Write a program that prompts the user to enter the names of two primary 
 * colors to mix. If the user enters anything other than “red,” “blue,” or 
 * “yellow,” the program should display an error message. Otherwise, the program 
 * should display the name of the secondary color that results by mixing two 
 * primary colors.
