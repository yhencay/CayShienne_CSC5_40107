 * Purpose: Homework Mobile Service Provider
 *      Problem: A mobile phone service provider has three different 
 * subscription packages for its customers:
 *    Package A: For $39.99 per month 450 minutes are provided. Additional 
 * minutes are $0.45 per minute.
 *    Package B: For $59.99 per month 900 minutes are provided. Additional 
 * minutes are $0.40 per minute.
 *    Package C: For $69.99 per month unlimited minutes provided.
 * Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill. It should ask 
 * which package the customer has purchased and how many minutes were used. It 
 * should then display the total amount due.
 *  Input Validation: Be sure the user only selects package A, B, or C.
