 * Purpose: Homework Area of Rectangle
 *      Problem: The area of a rectangle is the rectangleâ€™s length times its 
 * width. Write a program that asks for the length and width of two rectangles. 
 * The program should tell the user which rectangle has the greater area, or if 
 * the areas are the same.
