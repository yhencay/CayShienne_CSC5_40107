 * Purpose: Homework Sum Of Numbers
 *      Problem: Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. 
 * The program should use a loop to get the sum of all the integers from 1 up to 
 * the number entered. For example, if the user enters 50, the loop will find the 
 * sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, â€¦ 50.
